Joseph Bergen is an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and grew up in the southwest United States. Trained as a painter and architect, he lives and works out of Brooklyn, New York where he experiments in many media but focuses on oil painting.

#### Statement

Rejecting the easy myth of the “Noble Savage,” I focus on the internalized trauma of a colonized people in a way that explores the issues facing Native Americans today. Frequently Native Americans are portrayed as caricatures either as sports mascots, the antagonists in westerns, or simply reduced to a headdress at a music festival and as a result are relegated to history books where they become unreal. I draw on historical and contemporary imagery of the people, places and events that shaped, and continue to shape, the cultural identity of millions of people both united, and divided by a common past.
